# Simulate-and-recover
This project works in a way to simulate reaction time data based on the EZ diffusion model. The goal is to generate data using known parameters for boundary separation, drift rate, and non-decision time. The ranges included Boundary separation (a): [Between 0.5 and 2], Drift rate (v): Between [0.5 and 2], and the Non-decision time (t): Between [0.1 and 0.5]. This simulated data is used to recover the parameters via curve fitting. I generated the data for three different sample sizes (N = 10, 40, and 4000) and ran the simulation 1000 times for each sample size to ensure the results were reliable. Then, the parameters were recovered from the simulated data using the EZ model equations, and their accuracy is assessed by measuring bias and squared error across multiple iterations and sample sizes. 
Once the main script for simulating and recovering parameters was run (src/simulate_recover.py), the results were printed in the terminal and I moved them to the results tab/directory (results). This directory includes 3 files that display each sample size (results_N_10.txt, results_N_40.txt, results_N_4000.txt).  My results for when N=10 were: ​​Bias: [-0.24516708; -0.23503146; -0.10246337] & Squared Error: [0.25045499; 0.24865307; 0.02357111]. The model shows moderate bias in all three parameters (a, v, t). The bias for drift rate and boundary separation were the most noticeable. The squared error values are relatively large– indicating that the estimates are somewhat inconsistent. The results for N=40 were: Bias: [-0.26654483; -0.26461342; -0.1038952 ] and Squared Error: [0.26484602; 0.25469783; 0.02452939]. The bias for each parameter slightly increases compared to N = 10, especially for the boundary separation and drift rate. However, the squared error remains relatively consistent. This could suggest that the estimates are still reasonably accurate but still somewhat imprecise. The results for N=4000 were: Bias: [-0.24816262; -0.23777386; -0.10024916] and Squared Error: [0.24540124; 0.23843782; 0.02303562]. The bias and squared error both decrease. This indicates that the model is recovering the parameters more accurately with a larger sample size. The results for N = 4000 show that the EZ diffusion model performs better in terms of parameter recovery as the number of trials increases, reducing both the bias and squared error. 
The results of the simulation suggest that the EZ diffusion model can reasonably recover its parameters, especially when the sample size is large. As expected, the bias and squared error decrease as the sample size increases. We saw that with N = 4000 giving us the most accurate results. This demonstrates that the EZ diffusion model is a reliable tool for estimating decision-making parameters. However, for smaller sample sizes, such as N = 10, the model's parameter recovery is less precise. This highlights the importance of having a larger dataset for more accurate results.
